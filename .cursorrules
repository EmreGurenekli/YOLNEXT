# Cursor Rules for YOLNEXT Project

## MCP Playwright Configuration

When using Playwright browser automation via MCP:
1. Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `npx playwright install chromium`
2. Use direct Playwright scripts for testing when MCP server connection fails
3. All browser tests should verify: frontend accessibility, demo login functionality, and API connectivity

## Testing Workflow

1. **API Tests**: Always verify backend endpoints first
2. **Frontend Tests**: Check page accessibility and functionality
3. **Integration Tests**: Test full user workflows
4. **Browser Tests**: Use Playwright for E2E testing

## MCP Server Connection

If MCP Playwright server shows "Not connected":
- Check Playwright installation: `npx playwright --version`
- Install browsers: `npx playwright install chromium`
- Verify frontend is running: `http://localhost:5173`
- Use direct Playwright scripts as fallback
